                        Women and youth have always been considered by the world as vulnerable people with very little buying power. Illiteracy rate among women is the highest the world over. The girl child is considered as one belonging to another family and is married off prematurely without substantial investment into her life. There has to be a change.

                    <p>
                       Ever since I decided to start mobilizing women and youth and start coaching and mentoring them to discover and grow their potentials, I am the happiest woman in the world. Not only did I organize capacity building workshops for them in various fields but I helped to find jobs for quite a number of them with the help of God. I have motivated and boosted their morale so much that many are in leadership positions today. Many are now able to read and write. Others have learnt to use the computer or begin and manage income generating activities. Many have learnt that the wealth they created is not just for their use but that they must share it with the less-privileged. Those who never thought they could be leaders became successful leaders, even traveling outside the country for leadership conferences. There are amazing potentials in women and youth.

                      This website is about the work we have done since 2006. My desire is that this can be replicated in other countries by other passionate other people. We humans are social beings and are meant to encourage one another. A saying goes like this, “I am, because you are and you are because I am” It simply means that a woman or youth can become someone today because of the knowledge or help received from someone else. Monetary and material contributions will strengthen our initiatives with these women, as well as help and encourage more women and youth to work more effectively. Even further, we hope to convince many parents to stop early marriages among the girls and give them opportunities to develop their God-given potentials. Every child has a right to education. That is why we are able to impact the world today in various capacities. We have to leave something behind as a legacy for the next generation. 
                      I am deeply grateful and indebted to my parents, the late Alfred and Pricilla Okoro in South-East Nigeria who sacrificed their whole life’s earnings to send me and my eight siblings to school to the highest point we wanted to. They did it with a lot of joy and happiness though not without challenges. It was a worthy investment hence you can see the fruits in my life today and that of my siblings.
